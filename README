A Light FFMPEG client

Create a file called "twitch_key" and paste only your Twitch streaming key into it.
Then start the script. Obviously.

Note: the script needs ffmpeg-4.1 library to work. Either link it to the system's library compile a local version (what I'm doing at the moment)

Note 2: the script now installs the latest FFmpeg lib from github.
